# California Housing Price Prediction 🏠📊

A Machine Learning project to predict housing prices in California using regression models. This project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

- **Dataset**: California Housing Dataset (from sklearn.datasets or CSV)
- **Goal**: Predict median house value based on features like location, population, rooms, etc.
- **Tech Stack**: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 🔍 Workflow

1. Load and explore the dataset
2. Visualize insights using EDA
3. Clean and preprocess data
4. Train regression models (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, etc.)
5. Evaluate using RMSE, R² score
